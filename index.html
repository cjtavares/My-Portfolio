            My name is Christopher.  I live in Rhode Island.  I enjoy hanging out with friends playing board games, and RPGs.   I graduated from Johnson & Wales University in 2009 with a BS in Business Management.  Since then, I have worked in the QSR industry in a management role.    In a few months I would like to add that I have my certificate in Full Stack Web development here.
